# Creating a Website from Scratch

This entire project is just me fiddling with tools that can be used to develop beautiful websites in the future. While it would be cool if this project could be beautiful and polished, but that's **not what important**. Knowing how to make a website from blank text document is extremely important to me.

This is the space to play with ideas and tools. This is... *my* website.

## What am I creating?

Ok, to be a bit more specific, I am planning on creating a blog-like website that hosts content that I create dynamically. It should be rather flexible and simple. The focus should be on the content being shown rather than crazy effects and gradients. The content that I am putting up there is mainly text from my Obsidian notes, but there are a few supplemental videos and images.

## What have I implemented so far?

Well, I was able to implement:

- A basic navigation bar component
- Hover-based states
<!-- I plan to add to this section a ton. -->

## What am I planning on implementing?

I plan to implement:

- A database that stores all of my notes (i.e., `html` pages)
- A Hero (using ThreeJS)
- Flexbox Carousel
- A more advanced navigation bar
  - Drawers
  - Notifications
- Modals (in some way)
- Looping background video
