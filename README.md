# Creating a Website from Scratch

This entire project is just me fiddling with tools that can be used to develop beautiful websites in the future. While it would be cool if this project could be beautiful and polished, but that's **not what important**. Knowing how to make a website from blank text document is extremely important to me.

This is the space to play with ideas and tools. This is... *my* website.
